# QISKit simulators based on Sympy

This module contains [QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) simulators whose backends are written in Sympy. These simulators simulate a quantum circuit on a classical computer.

## Installation

Install this module via the PIP tool:

```
pip install qiskit_addon_sympy
```

PIP will handle all dependencies automatically.

## Usage

We recommend to follow the [usage example](examples/sympy_backends.py). More general information and education on running quantum simulation can be found in the [QISKit instruction page](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-core) and the QISKit tutorials.
